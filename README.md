This assignment will test the skills that you have developed over this week. You are to write a report
that covers the following points.
1. Based on the introductory lecture, write a Monte-Carlo that estimates the value of π

2. Use your code to study the convergence of the estimate of π towards its true value as you
increase the number of randoms used. Produce a plot demonstrating this.

3. Add a function to estimate the accuracy of the output as the number of randoms increases.
It is possible to use sample variance to do this – why?


4. Use the function you have written to add error estimates to your plot.

5. Next implement a root finding algorithm and use this to estimate π

6. How can you quantify the error for this technique?

7. Now that you have implemented two methods, can you suggest a third method to estimate
π

8. Based on everything you have learned this week, which estimate is more reliable, which has
the potential to be more accurate? Think about how the computer is generating the
numbers of the values of functions that you are using. Think about the data types you are
using.

9. Which method is more efficient (computationally efficient)?

10. Finally which method would you recommend using and why?
